# Project_2A


This is a work in progress project.
Reads from the file and stores each expression as a string in an array of strings.
Nothing else really works.
The Eval class doesnt like evaluating any expressions currently; i must have implemented it wrong.
The Precedence class should be fine but it doesnt do anything yet.
The Stack class should also be good to go, however since there are errors in the code maybe something needs to be tweaked there.
