# Project_2A

DOEST NOT WORK 

This is a work in progress project.
Reads from the file and stores each expression as a string in an array of strings
Nothing else really works
The Eval class doesnt like evaluating any expressions currently; i must have implemented it wrong
The Precedence class should be fine but it doesnt do anything yet
The Stack class should also be good to go, however since there are errors in the code maybe something needs to be tweaked there
